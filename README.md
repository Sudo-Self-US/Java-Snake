The index.html file should give an idea of how to use this code. However, below you can see how to initialize it into any div within a webpage.

    var mySnakeBoard = new SNAKE.Board( {
                                            boardContainer: "game-area",
                                            fullScreen: false,
                                            width: 580,
                                            height:400
                                        });
